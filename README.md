# Mining Rules Associated with the Fatal Accident Severity
My research objective is finding any association with the fatal accident severity in Greater Manchester using the Road Safety Data in the UK over last 5 years. Data on road safety in the UK are mostly based on personal-injury accidents reported to the police in the Stats19 collection. Stats19 is the most detailed, complete, and reliable single source of information on road casualties covering the whole of the UK, for monitoring trends over time. All the data variables are coded rather than containing textual strings. Information about the road casualty statistics, how they are collected, and the lookup tables are available in data.gov.uk.
